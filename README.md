# Simple Shell Project

## Overview

This is a project developed as part of the ALX program, focusing on creating a simple shell. The shell supports basic commands, built-in functions, and path execution.

## Files

- `main` - The entry point of the shell.
- `shell_loop` - Contains the main loop for the shell to read and execute commands.
- `read_line` - Responsible for reading a line of input from the user.
- `split_string` - Splits the input line into separate arguments.
- `interprete_string` - Interprets the input command to determine if it's a built-in function or an external command.
- `execute_command` - Executes external commands.
- `check_builtin` - Checks if a command is a built-in function.
- `check_path` - Checks if a command can be found in the system's PATH.
